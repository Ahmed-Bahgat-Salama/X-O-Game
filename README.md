# üéÆ Tic-Tac-Toe (XO Game) in C#

> A simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game built with C#

## üìñ About the Project  
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game where players **X and O** take turns marking spaces in a **3√ó3 grid**.  
The goal is to get **three of your marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)** to win.  
If all spaces are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a **draw**.  

This project is a simple **console-based** implementation, ideal for **beginners in C#** to understand key programming concepts such as:  
‚úÖ **Arrays** for board representation  
‚úÖ **Loops & Conditions** for game logic  
‚úÖ **User Input & Output** for interaction
